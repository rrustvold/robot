This is all the code for a differential drive robot car that I've been playing with. The car has a raspberry pi on it which drives the motors. Mounted onto the chassis is a webcam and an ultrasonic range sensor, which are positioned on top of a servo-motor. Originally I used the car to experiment with dead-reckoning controllers and state filters. 

Recently, I've been using the car to experiment with computer vision libraries. I've connected a joystick to my laptop which allows me to drive the car remotely from over the network. The car's webcam video is streamed back to the laptop. The laptop then does all of the computer vision processing. I can then have the car fixate on an object and follow it using camshift for example.
